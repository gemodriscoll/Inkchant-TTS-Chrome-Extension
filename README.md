# 🪻 Lavender: Text-to-Speech Reader

**Lavender** is a Chrome Extension that reads aloud text from any point on a webpage using your system's natural voice — all triggered from a simple right-click.

> ✨ This was my **first Chrome Extension project**, built as a way to learn how browser extensions work using JavaScript, the Chrome Extensions API, and the Web Speech API.  
> Please be kind — I'm learning as I go 💜

## 🎯 What It Does

With Lavender installed, you can:
- **Right-click** anywhere on a webpage and choose **"Read from Here with Lavender"**
- Have the text **read aloud from that point forward**
- Hear it read in a **calm, natural-sounding voice**, like Siri or Microsoft Zira

No need to highlight text or copy/paste anything — just click, sit back, and listen.
